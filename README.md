# Image-QA-Assistant
This project involves creating an Image QA Assistant using a Multi-Modal LLM (Gemini 1.5 Flash), which can understand and generate answers based on visual input. The model is deployed as a web application using Streamlit, providing an interactive platform where users can upload images and receive answers to their questions about images.
